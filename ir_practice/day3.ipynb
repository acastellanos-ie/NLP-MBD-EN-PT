    ">The ability to rank results by how relevant they are to the given query, whether relevance is calculated using TF/IDF (see [What Is Relevance?](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/master/relevance-intro.html)), proximity to a geolocation, fuzzy similarity, or some other algorithm.\n",

    ">The process of converting a block of text into distinct, normalized tokens (see [Analysis and Analyzers](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/master/analysis-intro.html) in order to (a) create an inverted index and (b) query the inverted index.\n",

    "\n",
    "Two types of text query:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Term-based\n",
    "\n",
    "Queries like the term or fuzzy queries are low-level queries that have no analysis phase. They operate on a single term. A term query for the term Foo looks for that exact term in the inverted index and calculates the TF/IDF relevance _score for each document that contains the term.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Full-text queries\n",
    "\n",
    "Queries like the match or query_string queries are high-level queries that understand the mapping of a field:\n",
    "\n",
    "* If you use them to query a date or integer field, they will treat the query string as a date or integer, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "* If you query an exact value (not_analyzed) string field, they will treat the whole query string as a single term.\n",
