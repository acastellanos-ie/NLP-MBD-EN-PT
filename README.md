# Natural Language Processing
Repository for the NLP class of the Big Data and Analytics Master. 

In this repository you will find all the technical materials related to this course (notebooks, scripts, files,...).

# Using the Repository

As we will cover in class, the most advanced NLP methodologies nowadays are based on Deep Learning models. These models, while providing an impressive performance in many task, have the limitation of their complexity and the computation power they require. In particular, in order to use these models, it is highly recommended to have a GPU at your disposal. As I imagine that most of you do not have one in your compute, my recommendation is to leverage [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).

Google Colab provides you an environment in which you can execute Python code and have access to GPUs. If you want to execute any of the notebooks in this repository in Colab, you can just click on the Open in Colab button at the beggining of each notebook. To that end, I have created a different folders for each one of the practices with the relevant notebooks.
